# Algorithms and Data Structures

Repository where I try to implement the main classic algorithms within computer science such as binary search, insertion sort, selection sort, mergesort, quicksort and etc. As well as data structures such as hash tables, linked lists, doubly linked lists, heaps, queues, trees, graphs and their algorithms for searches, insertions and deletions. This repository also contains my solution to the exercises proposed at the end of each chapter.
