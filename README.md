# Algorithms and Data Structures

Repository where I try to implement the main classic algorithms within computer science such as binary search, insertion sort, selection sort, mergesort, quicksort and etc. As well as data structures such as hash tables, linked lists, doubly linked lists, heaps, queues, trees, graphs and their algorithms for searches, insertions and deletions. This repository also contains my solution to the exercises proposed at the end of each chapter based on the book "A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms" by Jay Wengrow.

### âœ… Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed on your machine the following tools:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Preferably Node.js version >= v18. You can install Yarn **AFTER** installing Node.js with the following command:

To interact and edit the codebase you can use a text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
